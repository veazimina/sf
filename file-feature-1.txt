// For Internet of Things systems, maintenance testing may be triggered by the introduction of completely
new or modified things, such as hardware devices and software services, into the overall system. The
maintenance testing for such systems places particular emphasis on integration testing at different levels
(e.g., network level, application level) and on security aspects, in particular those relating to personal
data.
