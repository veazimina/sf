Impact analysis evaluates the changes that were made for a maintenance release to identify the intended
consequences as well as expected and possible side effects of a change, and to identify the areas in the
system that will be affected by the change. Impact analysis can also help to identify the impact of a
change on existing tests. The side effects and affected areas in the system need to be tested for
regressions, possibly after updating any existing tests affected by the change.
Impact analysis may be done before a change is made, to help decide if the change should be made,
based on the potential consequences in other areas of the system.
